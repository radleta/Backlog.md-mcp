## Description

Upgrade @modelcontextprotocol/sdk from 0.6.0 to 1.6.0+ to ensure Bun compatibility, as newer versions have better support for alternative runtimes.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 MCP SDK upgraded to version 1.6.0 or higher
- [ ] #2 No breaking changes identified or all resolved
- [ ] #3 Existing functionality still works
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

CRITICAL: carlosedp/mcp-bun successfully uses MCP SDK ^1.6.0 with StdioServerTransport and Bun, proving it works. They run with 'bun dist/mcp-bun.js'. Check their package.json for reference. Review MCP SDK changelog for breaking changes between 0.6.0 and 1.6.0 - major version jump!
