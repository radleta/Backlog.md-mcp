## Description

Convert the existing Node.js-based MCP server to run on Bun runtime while maintaining CLI-based integration. This establishes Bun compatibility before attempting direct integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Bun is installed and configured
- [ ] #2 All npm scripts converted to Bun equivalents
- [ ] #3 Build process uses 'bun build' instead of tsc
- [ ] #4 All existing MCP tools work with Bun runtime
- [ ] #5 Test suite passes under Bun
- [ ] #6 Development scripts updated for Bun
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Plan

1. Install Bun development environment
2. Update package.json scripts for Bun
3. Replace npm/node commands with Bun equivalents
4. Update build process to use bun build
5. Test all existing functionality
6. Update development scripts (dev.sh, build.sh)


## Implementation Notes

Key finding from research: Bun CAN work with StdioServerTransport despite earlier concerns. The carlosedp/mcp-bun project proves this with MCP SDK 1.6.0+. Earlier reports of Bun stream incompatibility appear resolved in newer versions. Keep using CLI spawning during this phase to isolate runtime conversion from integration changes.
