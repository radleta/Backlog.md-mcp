## Description

Implement a queue mechanism to serialize write operations and use atomic file operations (write to temp, then rename) to prevent corruption.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Design operation queue architecture
- [ ] #2 Implement atomic file write operations
- [ ] #3 Add conflict detection and resolution logic
- [ ] #4 Test queue performance with multiple instances
<!-- AC:END -->
