## Description

Measure performance improvements from direct integration. Compare CLI spawning vs direct Core calls. Optimize any bottlenecks found.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Benchmark suite created
- [ ] #2 CLI vs Core performance measured
- [ ] #3 Results documented with metrics
- [ ] #4 Bottlenecks identified and fixed
- [ ] #5 At least 50% performance improvement achieved
<!-- AC:END -->


## Implementation Notes

Expected improvements: CLI spawn overhead ~50-100ms per command eliminated. Direct calls should be <5ms. Memory: No child process creation. Test scenarios: 1) Create 100 tasks rapidly, 2) List 1000 tasks, 3) Bulk updates. Measure with console.time() or Bun's built-in profiler. Document before/after metrics in README. Consider caching Core instance to avoid re-initialization.
