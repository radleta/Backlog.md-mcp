# Backlog.md MCP Integration

This repository provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates [Backlog.md](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) with Claude Code, enabling Claude to directly manage tasks, view boards, and handle sprints through natural language.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime installed
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai) CLI tool
- Git for cloning with submodules

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone this repository with submodules**:
   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/[your-username]/backlog-mcp-integration.git
   cd backlog-mcp-integration
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install MCP server dependencies
   cd src
   bun install
   
   # Build the Backlog.md CLI
   cd ../Backlog.md
   bun install
   bun run build
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Code**:
   
   Use the Claude CLI to add the server:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add backlog-md -- bun run /absolute/path/to/backlog-mcp-integration/src/backlog-mcp-server.ts
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Replace `/absolute/path/to/backlog-mcp-integration` with the actual absolute path to where you cloned this repository.

## Usage

Once the MCP server is connected, you can interact with your backlog through Claude using natural language:

### Example Commands

- **Creating Tasks**:
  - "Create a new high-priority task for implementing user authentication"
  - "Add a task titled 'Fix login bug' with urgent priority"

- **Viewing Tasks**:
  - "Show me all tasks that are in progress"
  - "List all blocked tasks"
  - "What high-priority tasks do I have?"

- **Managing Tasks**:
  - "Move task-123 to done"
  - "Edit task-456 to change its priority to high"
  - "Delete task-789"

- **Board & Sprint Operations**:
  - "Display the Kanban board"
  - "Create a new sprint starting Monday for 2 weeks"
  - "Show the current sprint details"

## Data Storage

**Important**: This MCP server does not store any backlog data itself. It acts as a bridge between Claude Code and the Backlog.md CLI tool.

### How Data Storage Works

- **Backlog data location**: All tasks, boards, and sprint data are stored by the underlying Backlog.md CLI according to its own configuration and working directory
- **MCP server config**: Only stores server settings in `~/.backlog-mcp/config.json` (things like custom CLI path)
- **Claude Code config**: Stores MCP server connection details in Claude Code's MCP configuration

### Finding Your Backlog Data

To determine where your backlog files are actually saved:
- Ask Claude: "What's the current backlog storage configuration?"
- Or use: "Show me the backlog config settings"
- The MCP server will query the Backlog.md CLI to get the actual data storage location

### Data Backup

Since all data is managed by the Backlog.md CLI, refer to the [Backlog.md documentation](https://github.com/MrLesk/Backlog.md) for backup and data management procedures.

## Development

### Running the Server Standalone

For testing and development:

```bash
cd src
bun run start
```

### Updating Backlog.md

To update to the latest version of Backlog.md:

```bash
git submodule update --remote Backlog.md
cd Backlog.md
bun install
bun run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Connecting
- Ensure you're using absolute paths in the Claude configuration
- Verify Bun is installed and accessible in your PATH
- Verify the MCP server was properly configured with Claude Code

### Commands Failing
- Ensure the Backlog.md CLI is built: `cd Backlog.md && bun run build`
- Check that you have a valid backlog structure in your working directory
- Verify the backlog configuration with: `cd Backlog.md && bun run cli config list`

### Debugging
- The MCP server logs to stderr, which won't interfere with Claude communication
- Check Claude Code logs for connection errors
- Run the server standalone to see detailed error messages
